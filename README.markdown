# ebritton.com

## Purpose

This Rails 3 project will replace the existing legacy http://ebritton.com

I will be using this site to dive into the Carrier Wave attachment gem, rather than my usual Paperclip. I will also be learning Active Admin to power the back end.

It is still under active development.
